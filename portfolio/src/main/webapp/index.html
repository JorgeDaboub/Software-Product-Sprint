                        <p>Partnered with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign our research aimed to improve
                            an already built medical application which served to aid doctors when dealing with emergency
                            situations. The applications receive user inputs in a tablet by a medical staff member
                            relating to the condition and actions that have been taken on a patient in critical
                            condition. The application then recommends the medical team for further steps. My work
                            consited of training an acoustic model to recognize speech input by the medical team to be
                            used as an interface. The model was trained using the open source software Kaldi and trained
                            with over 25 speakers and multiple medical terms. Once the model was trained, I set up the
                            server machine to listen for http requests. Once a request with a .wav file was received the
                            server would call on a python script to decode the .wav file using the acoustic model and
                            then return the result to the client. From the client-side using the open-source project
                            Porcupine, I programmed a python script that recognizes a wake word then records the .wav
                            file to then be sent to the server to be decoded, allowing for a practical implementation of
                            the project.</p>

                        <p>Collaborated on the design, building and implementation of the Air Breaking System. Our task
                            was to ensure that as our rocket was overshot the target apogee the air braking system would
                            deploy accordingly to slow the rocket down in order not to go over. I was specifically
                            involved in the testing and implementation of the sensors to be used. This included
                            measuring acceleration, angular velocity, pressure – altimeter through multiple sensors
                            connected to an Arduino one board. Aided one of our senior members incorporated the use of a
                            Kalman filter on the data received by the sensors, providing more accurate data. This was an
                            essential addition as we were getting inconsistent data readings on some of the sensors
                            which was drastically affecting efficiency.</p>

                <p>Apart from programming, I enjoy spending time outdoors. One of my favorite pastime is playing tennis
                    and have practiced it for many years now.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow like to watch some sci-fi series along the lines of Doctor
                    Who and Sherlock. At the same time I enjoy spending a large amount of my free time exploring the
                    latest emerging technology and most recent blockchains news.</p>
